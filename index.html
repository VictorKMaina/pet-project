  <h1 id="heading">This is Bruno.</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Bruno was born as a stray on the streets of Mombasa in 2019. His mother left him alone in a box on the streets. Luckily for him, he was found by a kind family that took him in as one of their own. Now, Bruno lives a life most dogs could only dream of.</p>
  <p>Bruno loves his chew toys. His favorite is a little rubber duck that makes a squeaky sound. Because he is extremly playful, Bruno hardly ever sleeps.</p>
  <p>Bruno is also one of those canines that hates his dog food. But put him in front of some fresh tuna, and he will simply go crazy!</p>
  <p>There are many other animals like Bruno. Most of them die on the street, or end in animal shelters where they're treated poorly. So the next time you see a poor, young puppy shivering out in the cold, don't hesitate to lend a hand.</p>
